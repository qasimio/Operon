# Code of Conduct

## Our Standards

Operon is a technical project. Interactions in this repository — issues, pull requests, discussions, and code review — should be focused on the work.

Expected behaviour:

- Be technically precise in criticism. "This regex will fail on Unicode identifiers" is useful. "This is bad code" is not.
- Provide context when you disagree. If a design decision seems wrong, explain why with specifics.
- Assume good faith. People contribute at different skill levels and with different context.
- Respect that maintainers have finite time. A slow response is not a rejection.

Unacceptable behaviour:

- Personal attacks, insults, or harassment of any kind
- Dismissing contributions without explanation
- Sustained off-topic disruption in issues or PR threads
- Sharing private information without consent

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by this project: the GitHub repository, issue tracker, pull requests, and any affiliated communication channels.

## Enforcement

Violations can be reported to the project maintainer via GitHub. Reports will be reviewed and responded to. Accounts that repeatedly violate this policy will be blocked from the repository.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.
