## Support Operon
github: qasimio

Operon is an open-source effort focused on building autonomous repository intelligence for developers.

The project explores a different direction for AI-assisted software engineering: local-first, transparent, and deterministic systems that understand entire codebases instead of isolated files.

Sponsorship helps support:

* Continued development and maintenance
* New language and AST integrations
* Performance improvements
* Documentation and ecosystem tooling
* Long-term sustainability of Operon

If Operon improves your workflow or helps your team, consider sponsoring its development.

Every contribution directly supports ongoing research and development of open developer infrastructure.

Thank you for supporting open source.
